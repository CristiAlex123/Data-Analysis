# **Bike Share Usage Analysis**

An interactive Power BI dashboard for the analysis of biking sharing patterns, aimed at emerging trends of user behavior and demand over a period of time, to showcase how data analytics and BI can help in mobility solutions for cities.

Bike-sharing systems generates an enormous database of useful information that can be used to improve user experience and attract as many new people as possible to use it. This project can answer some key questions that help to develop the business as efficiently as possible. 
Some questions are:

* What kind of users use bike sharing services most frequently? (subscriptions or one time only)
* How does bike usage vary over time?
* What are the most commonly used areas and how long do they use them?

## A description of each dashboard
