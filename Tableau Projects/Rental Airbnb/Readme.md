# Rent Apartment Analysis 

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive Tableau dashboard that analyzes apartment rental data, with the objective of identifying pricing patterns, location-based differences, and key factors influencing rental costs. The real estate rental market is highly dynamic and influenced by multiple variables such as location, apartment size, and pricing structure.

## Content & Analysis

* Examine how features such as size or room configuration relate to pricing
