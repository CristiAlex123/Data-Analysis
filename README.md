# Data Analysis

This repository contains a collection of data analysis and business intelligence projects focused on extracting insights from data through analysis and visualization. Projects cover a variety of domains and are built using tools commonly used in **Data Analyst / BI** roles. 

Each project includes its own documentation describing the context, analysis and key findings. This repository serves as a personal portfolio, showcasing **practical data analysis skills** and an **analytical approach**.

This repository contains projects made in Power BI, Excel, SQL and Tableau. In the future I plan to add more analysis projects made in **Python**, more **complex** and useful analysis of everyday life.
